Hello, I'm Johnny Adora and this is my story:
Growing up by the Belgian seaside, I got into sports such as kitesurfing and skateboarding from a very young age, which gave me a passion for boards and their designs.

I started by painting on my first skateboard which I got when I was 11 years old.

Re-shaping it first, then re-painting it again and again. Eventually people's used boards started to find their way to me and that's how I got into recycling old skateboards into newly shaped, hand-painted, little works of art. 

Later I expanded my canvas to walls and entire rooms, the bigger the better. Do you know the expression “a Jack of all trades”? It changed over time, first it was simply “Jack of all trades”, then it became “Jack of all trades, master of none.” and eventually it became: “Jack of all trades, master of none, but better than a master of one.”

Before it became a Jack of all trades, it used to be a Johnny Do-it-all. So I guess that's what I am now.

I paint and I make things.
